    My career goal for as long as I could remember has always to be a Physicist, be it in the most general sense
    or specializeed in a particular field. That being a clear goal of mine I went straight into Mechanical Engineering as a major in college.
    <br> &emsp; &ensp;
    At the time, I saw that as the best route for me to get a more practical understanding of Physics and a more viable and reliable 
    source of income after graduating the program. After a few semesters I realized that working a full time job and being enrolled in an 
    accelerated learning program was too rigorous for me to manage successfully, so I switched my major to Astrophysics. 
    another 18 months in and I am feeling confident in my education path, excited to finally get enrolled in courses that were more specialized
    and geared towards a particular field.
    <br> &emsp; &ensp;
    Then the unthinkable happened. Towards the end of my 7th semester when enrolling for classes
    I got the news that I had lost my scholarship for reasons out of my control. Being outside of the deadline to apply for scholarships for the 
    following semester, I had no choice but to drop out or bear the financial responsibility of my education on my own.
    Reluctantly I dropped out. Since 2016 I have felt my education has more or less ended. 
    <br> &emsp; &ensp;
    The skills, lessons, and knowledge I gained from my jobs have proven invaluable to me, however they did not satisfy or stimulate my desire for higher learning.
    It was not until the middle of 2021 that a friend of mine suggested learning to code as both a means to have a fulfilling career and
    as a way for me to potentially fund my continued education in the Physics field. He suggested a few languages to start out with and a decent 
    website to start learning on. I immediately registered and started taking courses on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java, along with having 
    other languages and courses lined up to follow those. 
    <br> &emsp; &ensp;
    Though I am still new to it all and have never considered myself to be a tech 
    guy outside of hardware, I find myself fulfilled and excited to be learning again! I have enjoyed every moment making this simple website 
    and plan to continue to update it with with any new things that I learn. I hope to one day be able to list your Company as a 
    work experience!
